# Programming Exercise 1
Write a program that will allow user to input the student's name, grade, and fees.
Compute and print the total discount using the table below.

| Grade | Max Discount |
| ---   | ---          |
| >95   | 2000         |
| 90-95 | 1000         |
| <90   | 500          |

Compute the total amount to pay where the formula is fees minus the total discount.
Below is a sample output:

```
enter your name   : kiko
enter your grade  : 85
enter your fees   : 2500

kiko your discount is 500 and the total amount to pay is 2000
```

## Submission

```c#
using System;
class Sep21 {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        Console.Write("enter your name   : ");
        string name = Console.ReadLine();
        Console.Write("enter your grade  : ");
        int grade = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.Write("enter your fees   : ");
        int fees = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

        int discount;
        if (grade > 95) {
            discount = 2000;
        } else if (grade >= 90) {
            discount = 1000;
        } else {
            discount = 500;
        }

        // Check if discount is greater than fees
        if (discount > fees) {
            discount = fees;
            fees = 0;
        } else {
            fees -= discount;
        }

        Console.WriteLine(); //Blank Line
        Console.Write(name + " your discount is " + discount);
        Console.WriteLine(" and the total amount to pay is " + fees);
    }

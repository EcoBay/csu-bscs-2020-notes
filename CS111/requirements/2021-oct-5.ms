.IP 1. 3
.B Hardware
.PP
Hardware are the physical components of a computing system. This are the components that can be touched. These parts are often housed withing a laptop or a desktop chassis and comes in a variety of sizes from computer chips smaller that a hole of a needle to room size computers.

Processor@T{
.PP
It is responsible of processing input data to informations. It can process variety of information such as graphics for GPU, tensor operations for TPU, and more.
T}
Memory@T{
.PP
Where computer stores data and/or instructions. It can be classified to either persistent or non-persistent memory. Persistent memory stores data indefinitely while non-persistent memory losses information on certain conditions.
T}
Keyboard@T{
.PP
Keyboard is an example of an input device which is used to interact with a computer. It can be used to enter characters, symbols, and also some commands to the computer.
T}
Monitor@T{
.PP
Monitor is one of the most basic form of output device. It is used to present information in graphical or textual form to the user.
T}
Printer@T{
Same as the monitor it is also an example of an output device but outputs in a tangible form known as a hard copy. It often used to write information in 2d form but nowadays it can also print in 3d form.

.IP 2. 3
.B Software
.PP
Computer software are the instructions or programs that runs on top of the computer hardware. It is often stored in a memory but can sometimes often be ingrained in the computers hardware it self or a Read-Only Memory (ROM).

Operating System@T{
.PP
OS is an example of system software it is a very important as it is what allows other software to use computer hardware without the complexity of having different code for different hardware configurations.
T}
Compiler@T{
.PP
It is a program that translate high level programming language to a format that can be natively understand by the computer known as a machine code.
T}
Interpreter@T{
.PP
Similar with the compiler it is also a program that translate a programming language into machine code. The only difference is that compiler convert code into an executable that can be run while interpreter run commands one at a time.
T}
Shell@T{
.PP
The shell is a computer software that allow the user to interface with the OS and run commands and other software. It can be either a Graphical User Interface such as in the Windows OS wherein you click programs to run.
T}
Browser@T{
.PP
Browser is a computer program with a graphical user interface for displaying and navigating between web pages.

Clients@T{
.PP
A client is someone who hires a contract software development company to design and build custom software.
T}
Programmers@T{
.PP
Programmers are someone that writes code to develop software.
T}
Computer Engineers@T{
.PP
Computer Engineers are the one that assembles a computing system. They are the one that constructs computer infrastructure to run programs or servers.
T}
Users/Consumers@T{
.PP
Users or Consumers are the end user of a software and where the client get their return of investments
T}
Systems Engineers@T{
.PP
Similar to the computer engineering is one that assembles computing system but unlike them, where they aim to deliver a program to end users, they deliver the whole system instead in a integrated package.
